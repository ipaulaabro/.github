I’m Paula, your friendly neighborhood programmer/web developer in the making! Aspiring to conquer the digital realm 1px at a time!

## Mission:  :coffee:  :soon:  :computer:
Turn caffeine into code and dreams into dynamic websites!

## What I do:  :woman_technologist: :heavy_plus_sign: :woman_technologist:  :heavy_plus_sign: :woman_technologist:
When I’m not busy coding you’ll probably find me lost in the magical world of Codecademy. If they gave out badges for binge-learning, I’d have a trophy room by now! :trophy: :books:
